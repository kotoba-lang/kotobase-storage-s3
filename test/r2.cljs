(ns r2
  "The contract through `r2-client`, against a real R2Bucket binding.

  `test/run.cljs` runs the contract against `object-store`, a mock written
  in this repo to the shape `open` expects. That verifies `S3Storage`, and
  nothing else: it never calls `r2-client`, so the code that actually
  translates a CAS into `bucket.put(key, body, {onlyIf: {etagMatches}})`
  had no coverage at all -- while being the client this adapter recommends
  and the one a Workers deployment would use.

  A mock cannot close that gap, because the question is precisely whether
  the R2 API behaves as the adapter assumes. Miniflare's R2 is an
  implementation of that API, and it does enforce the preconditions
  (checked directly before writing this: `etagDoesNotMatch: \"*\"` on an
  existing object is rejected, `etagMatches` with a wrong ETag is rejected,
  and with the right one is accepted). So the race runs against something
  that can actually refuse.

  This is still not Cloudflare's production R2. What it establishes is that
  `r2-client` speaks the R2 API correctly and that the profile it claims
  survives contention against an implementation of that API. Whether the
  production service matches its own API implementation is what
  `probe-conditional-put!` is for, and that has not been run against the
  real endpoint yet."

  "`r2-client` with the precondition stripped out of the put.

   Everything else is the real R2 binding. This is what the adapter would
   be if `onlyIf` were dropped or misspelled -- and misspelled matters:
   `onlyIf` takes an options object, so a typo in the key name is silently
   ignored by R2 rather than rejected, which is the failure this whole
   exercise is about. A green race means nothing unless it can catch it."

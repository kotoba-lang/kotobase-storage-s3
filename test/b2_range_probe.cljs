;; b2_range_probe.cljs — the one claim miniflare cannot settle: does a REAL
;; S3-compatible endpoint honour our Range header, byte for byte?
;;
;; `test/object_r2.cljs` in kotobase-storage-s3 checks the R2 conversion
;; against miniflare, which is an implementation of the R2 API and not R2.
;; The signed-HTTP client converts differently -- to an inclusive
;; `Range: bytes=a-b` -- and two things about that have never met a real
;; server:
;;
;;   1. whether the endpoint returns exactly the bytes we asked for
;;      (one too many is the first byte of the NEXT CAR frame, which parses);
;;   2. whether SigV4 with a `range` header among the signed headers is
;;      accepted at all, or 403s on canonicalisation.
;;
;; It packs a real CARv2, PUTs it, ranges one frame back out, verifies the
;; frame's CID, and deletes the object. Credentials come from the Keychain
;; item named in the secrets map (service `b2:ai-gftd-datasets`,
;; account = key id, password = app key) and are never printed.

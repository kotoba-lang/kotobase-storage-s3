  "The large-object plane: contract conformance, plus the parts the contract
  cannot reach.

  The contract can check that a grant *reports* signing `content-length`. It
  cannot check that the signature actually covers it -- a provider could
  return `:signed-headers [\"host\" \"content-length\"]` next to a URL whose
  `X-Amz-SignedHeaders` says `host`, and the contract would pass while every
  grant remained a blank cheque. So this file signs with real credentials
  through real WebCrypto and reads the property back out of the URL S3 will
  actually verify against."

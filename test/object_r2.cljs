  "The large-object contract, including its range half, against a real
  R2Bucket binding.

  `test/object_run.cljs` runs the same contract against in-memory clients
  written in this repo. That verifies `object-s3`'s wiring and nothing about
  R2: the question a ranged read raises is precisely whether the R2 API means
  what this adapter assumes it means. R2 takes an **offset and a length**; the
  storage contract is **half-open `[start, end)`**. The conversion is one
  subtraction, and a mock written from the same assumption would agree with
  it whether or not it was right.

  Miniflare implements the R2 API, so it can disagree."

(ns r2-live-bench
  "Driver for the live R2 latency / CAS benchmark worker.

  `test/race.cljs` says plainly why this exists: the sequential storage
  contract passes for a backend that ignores preconditions entirely, because
  read-and-compare answers correctly either way. Only concurrent writers on one
  ref can tell the two apart, and only a REAL bucket can tell us whether R2
  itself enforces `onlyIf.etagMatches` -- the question ADR-2608039000 turns on.

  The worker answers with a `conditional_race` block. **A run in which that
  block is absent is not a passing run**: `winners` missing and `winners` = 1
  must not produce the same exit status, or the benchmark would report success
  for a worker that never ran the race.

  Run the worker first (see README):
    wrangler dev --remote --config wrangler.r2-bench.jsonc --port 8799 \\
      --var BENCH_LIVE_ENABLED:1
    npm run bench:r2-live"

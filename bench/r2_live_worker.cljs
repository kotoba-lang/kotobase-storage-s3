(ns r2-live-worker
  "The live half of the R2 benchmark: bounded PUT/HEAD/GET samples and an
  eight-writer ETag race, run inside a Worker against a real bucket.

  The race is the point. `test/race.cljs` says why the sequential contract
  cannot see it: read-and-compare answers correctly whether or not the provider
  enforces `onlyIf`, so a backend that ignores preconditions entirely passes.
  Eight writers that all read the SAME etag can tell the two apart, and only a
  real bucket can say whether R2 does -- the question ADR-2608039000 turns on.

  Every key written is unique to one run and deleted in a `finally`, so a run
  that throws still cleans up. Disabled unless BENCH_LIVE_ENABLED is \"1\".")

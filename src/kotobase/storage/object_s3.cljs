  "The large-object plane for S3-compatible endpoints and R2.

  This is what removes a 4 MiB ceiling that was never the storage's: the
  live `PUT /ipfs/:cid` path caps there because the Worker buffers the body,
  and a Worker has a memory budget while B2 does not care how large the
  object is (ADR-2608012600, Context 2). A GB object must not travel through
  the process that asked for it, so the fix is not a bigger buffer -- it is
  to stop being in the path.

  ## Which profile a store gets is decided by the client, not by this file

  `signed-client` holds SigV4 credentials, so it can hand a caller a URL and
  step out of the way: `:presigned-transfer`.

  An `r2-client` holds a Workers **binding**. A binding has no credentials to
  sign with -- it is an object with `get`/`put` methods, usable only from
  inside the Worker -- so a store built on one cannot redirect anybody
  anywhere, and declares `:proxied-transfer`. That is not this adapter being
  conservative; it is the only true statement available, and the profile
  exists so the caller learns it at open time rather than on the first
  large upload.

  Same discipline as the ref profile next door, and for the same reason: the
  failure mode of guessing is silent.

  ## A PUT grant without a size is refused

  `-presign-put` requires `:size-bytes` and rejects without it. `content-length`
  is signed, so the grant only accepts a body of exactly that length --
  otherwise whoever holds the URL may store any number of bytes under a CID
  whose digest they never had to know.

  Refusing the sizeless call is the half that matters. Binding the size only
  when one is offered still leaves the blank cheque available to every caller
  that omits it, which is the caller streaming an object of unknown length --
  i.e. exactly the large ones this plane is for."

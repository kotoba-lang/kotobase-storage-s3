(ns kotobase.storage.s3
  "S3-compatible and Cloudflare R2 implementation of kotobase-storage.

  **\"S3-compatible\" does not imply a conditional PUT.** The ref CAS here is
  an ETag precondition, and whether it holds is a property of the endpoint,
  not of this code:

  - **R2** evaluates `onlyIf.etagMatches` natively. Linearizable.
  - **AWS S3** supports `If-None-Match: *` and `If-Match` on PutObject.
    Linearizable, once confirmed for the account/region in use.
  - **Backblaze B2** has NO conditional write on either its native or its
    S3-compatible API. A PUT carrying `If-Match` succeeds regardless, so a
    read-then-write CAS silently loses updates under concurrency.

  This namespace therefore does not decide the profile from the fact that a
  client was supplied. Each client declares what its endpoint actually
  enforces, `open` refuses to promote an unverified one, and
  `probe-conditional-put!` turns \"verified\" into something a deployment
  runs rather than something a comment asserts.

  An earlier version declared `:linearizable-ref` unconditionally, for any
  endpoint. The older, production `kotobase-peer` object store had this
  right already -- it fails closed behind `MERKLE_S3_CONDITIONAL_HEAD` with
  the note \"only for a backend with conditional PutObject\" -- and this is
  that discipline, made executable."

  `Conditional ETag should not be wrapped in quotes`. So a literal
  sentinel is wrong for one of them whichever way it is written, and it
  fails loudly on R2 rather than reporting: the probe throws instead of
  answering, on the client it most needs to answer for. Flipping the hex
  digits of the real ETag keeps the quoting, length and shape the endpoint

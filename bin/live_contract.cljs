(ns live-contract
  "Run the shared storage contract against a REAL S3-compatible endpoint, and
  probe conditional writes directly.

  The only existing test drives `s3/open` with an in-memory fake that
  reimplements S3 semantics as the author understood them. It proves the
  adapter agrees with that model -- not with S3. The two behaviours a fake
  cannot check are exactly the two this backend's correctness rests on:

    * `If-None-Match: *` on PUT -- how block creation rejects a CID/bytes
      collision;
    * `If-Match: <etag>` on PUT -- the ref compare-and-set the single-writer
      head model is built on.

  Conditional-write support genuinely differs across S3-compatible providers.
  A provider that silently IGNORES those headers returns 200 to BOTH writers,
  so the loser is told it won. From a fake that is invisible; in production it
  means storage enforces nothing and two heads can diverge.

  The probes below therefore do not go through the contract: they call the
  client directly, so the result is about the PROVIDER rather than about the
  adapter's interpretation of it.

  Usage (credentials come from a credential tool, never typed here):

    S3_ENDPOINT=... S3_BUCKET=... S3_REGION=... \\
    S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=... S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=... \\
    node out/live-contract.js

  Writes only under S3_PREFIX (default: a timestamped probe prefix). Nothing
  outside that prefix is read or modified."
